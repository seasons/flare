            We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to
            time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the www.seasons.nyc website, by
            sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal
            notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still
            govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you
            use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of
            the changes. Use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such
            information is collected.
